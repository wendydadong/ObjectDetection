This repository contains some scipts about object detection models implemented in TensorFlow:

* How to run this test:  
```python
python3 objDetect.py
```

* Notice pretrained models in the file named pbModel  
```python  
PATH_TO_CKPT = '/media/sf_XubuntuShareFile/frozen_inference_graph_resnet.pb'  
```  
Try to change other pretrained models in the following reference projects.
